===========================================

As app developers know, app market is tough and competitive. It requires creativity to come up with a good app that is not only effective and useful to the customer, but also serves his or her needs. You also know that having a successful app is not just about the technicalities, but also about how you introduce your app to the market. It is never enough to come up with an app, what matters more is how you’re going to entice the customers to even consider trying your app. This is where marketing strategies come in.

There are many independent app developers out there who have been successful in the business even without shelling out big money for high-end marketing and well-trained marketing teams. In fact, you can do the marketing on your own. You just have to step up and go for the extra mile.

##Identify Your Target Audience

In planning your marketing strategy, you have to pose some questions first:

1. Who is my target market? What is the age range and gender? What are their interests?

2. What is the purpose of my mobile app? What purpose will it serve my target market?

3. How do I get my target market hooked to my app?

##Plan Your Marketing Strategy

Here are some things you have to remember in coming up with less costly marketing strategies:

###First impressions last. 
When you package your app, be sure that you have a presentable and attention-grabbing app store page. What should be included?
 
1. A catchy name  – Your app should be easy to recall.
2. A unique logo – The name should be the first thing your customers will think about when they see this logo, so it should be good.
3. Sample screenshots and videos – These will serve as a preview of what your customers can expect from your app.
4. Reviews, reviews and more reviews. This is crucial to convert your clicks into downloads.

###Introduce your app nicely. 
While most app developers disregard this, it is always recommended that you build a site for your app. It can just be a simple website with a few pages that will tell something about your app. In this site you can explain fully what your app is all about and what your customers can get from downloading it. You can also include a box here for feedback and encourage your customers to subscribe to your page for further announcements. In this way, your website serves as your personal space with your customers.

###Create some buzz. 
Your customers should be aware that you have an app out there that they will enjoy. How do you do that? Take advantage of blogs. Write blog articles talking about your app and how exciting it is to use it. The more content you have in more blogs, the better it is. Be sure to use keywords related to your app or game so that your customers can easily find it on Google and other search engines. You can also maximize social networking sites and create buzz on Facebook and Twitter and have people, probably your friends, talk about it. In that way, information about your app will be shared from one person to another, creating hype. You can also ask the gadget and tech bloggers to help popularize your app. That way, people will talk about your blog at the first day of your launching.
*Ask for ratings. You have to know what your app users have to say about your app. This is why most apps ask their downloaders to rate their app, and you can do it too. The higher the rating your app gets, the higher chance it has to be downloaded. Mobile users who check first what others who have downloaded it already said about the app’s performance and they base their decision on whether they’re going to download it or not on these reviews. It will also help you popularize your app because the higher your rating is, the higher chance of it being included in the top downloaded apps in the app store. Some app users are not going to browse all the apps. If your app is included in the list of top ten, then it will be positioned ahead of other apps and your app has a better chance of being downloaded right away.

##Determine your marketing budget
To determine your marketing budget you must calculate calculate your minimum and maximum allowable ad budgets. The next steps are what Roy Williams from Ad Wizard suggest you should do before you pour money into advertising. 

Step 1: Take 10 percent and 12 percent of your projected annual, gross sales and multiply each by the markup made on your average transaction.
Step 2: Deduct your annual cost of occupancy (rent) from the adjusted 10 percent of sales number and the adjusted 12 percent number.
Step 3: The remaining balances represent your minimum and maximum allowable ad budgets for the year.
After you settle your target, your goals and your budget you are finally ready to start your campaign. 

##Keep Learning
