####1 Take note of the size and dimensions of the ad that  the networks support

There is no standard size for mobile ad, so you have to be extra careful to design a creative for the exact dimensions. It can be a regular banner, expandable, full screen image, or Facebook mobile ad. 
Here are some examples of different ad sizes:

####2 Create at least 3 images each week and rotate them frequently
When creating mobile ad you’ll need to rotate every time period, we recommend each week, to prevent saturating your market. Have one or two basic design and apply little variations, try different colors, texts, etc. 
Also, when creating your images take in consideration in which network you plan to advertize. For example, as Facebook is a social network, images of people work best preferably faces. Use close-ups of attractive faces that resemble your target audience. Remember, emotion rules. 
If you are promoting a game in other networks create ads with the main characters and play with different fonts, or the more appealing features of your game. 

####3 Write as many lines as you can, think outside the box
No one can tell you in advance which text will be the best  to promote your app. Only the audience will tell you that. However, you can start by writing as many lines as you can considering your target audience. 
Try the AIDA formula (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action), also try reckless and even lines that will shake your audience, make them feel uncomfortable or write something absurd.
This might sound crazy, but audiences are tired of stumbling across millions of ads that say “Have fun!” or “Download free”. Think outside the box on this one, and try as many lines as you can come up with, once they have runned the audience will tell you what direction to follow. 

####4 Balance the space between image and text, images are more important
We live in a mostly visual world. Some networks even limit the writing space, for example Facebook only allows a max. 90 characters ad. This is for a reason, they are well aware that images sells. Privilege the images you create and only use 20% of the space on your creatives for text. 

The most important thing to keep in mind is that you have to try as many creatives as possible and the audience will have the last word. Hope this tips help you create the best creatives to promote your app.
